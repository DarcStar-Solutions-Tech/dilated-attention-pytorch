# Benchmark Tracking Status Report

**Date**: 2025-06-27 17:16 UTC  
**Current Commit**: 61cdef7b

## Summary

The benchmark infrastructure for tracking performance across commits has been implemented but is only partially deployed.

## Current Status

### ✅ Working Components

1. **Infrastructure Created**:
   - `BenchmarkOutputManager` - Handles consistent output format with git tracking
   - `BenchmarkStorage` - Organizes results by date and type
   - `BenchmarkAggregator` - Analyzes trends across commits
   - Proper directory structure in `docs/benchmarks/`

2. **Scripts Using New System**:
   - `benchmark.py` - ✅ Fully updated
   - `benchmark_all.py` - ✅ Just updated (as of commit 61cdef7b)

3. **Data Being Collected**:
   - Git commit hash for each benchmark
   - Hardware information
   - Timestamp and parameters
   - Results in standardized format

### ❌ Issues

1. **Most Scripts Not Updated** (8 out of 10):
   - `benchmark_all_implementations.py`
   - `benchmark_distributed.py`
   - `benchmark_extreme_sequences.py`
   - `benchmark_flash_attention_3.py`
   - `benchmark_long_sequences.py`
   - `benchmark_ring_billion_tokens.py`
   - `benchmark_sequence_limits.py`
   - `comprehensive_benchmark_comparison.py`
   - `simple_benchmark_comparison.py`

2. **Legacy Results**:
   - 7 benchmark files in old format without git tracking
   - Cannot be used for performance trend analysis

## Performance Data Available

### By Commit

| Commit | Date | Benchmarks Run | Key Findings |
|--------|------|----------------|--------------|
| 61cdef7b | 2025-06-27 | all-implementations | BlockSparse ~60ms avg, Ring/Improved ~4-9ms |
| fbade2bf | 2025-06-27 | memory-pool tests | 52.6% allocation speed improvement |
| 0bcc7082 | 2025-06-27 | attention-comparison | Basic comparison data |

### Performance Trends

Due to limited data across commits, full trend analysis is not yet possible. However:

1. **Memory Pool Improvements** (commit fbade2bf):
   - 52.6% faster buffer allocation
   - Fragment-aware allocation working
   - NUMA-aware topology detection

2. **Latest Performance** (commit 61cdef7b):
   - RingDilatedAttention: Fastest at 4.44ms (1024 seq)
   - ImprovedDilatedAttention: 4.46ms (1024 seq)
   - BlockSparse implementations: ~40ms (90% slower but 90% memory savings)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Update Remaining Benchmark Scripts**:
   ```bash
   # Patches have been generated in:
   scripts/benchmark_patches/
   ```

2. **Run Comprehensive Benchmarks**:
   ```bash
   # After updating scripts, run:
   python benchmarks/benchmark_all_implementations.py
   python benchmarks/benchmark_long_sequences.py
   python benchmarks/comprehensive_benchmark_comparison.py
   ```

3. **Migrate Legacy Results**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/migrate_benchmarks.py
   ```

### For Continuous Tracking

1. **Add to CI/CD**:
   - Run benchmarks on each PR
   - Compare against baseline
   - Flag performance regressions

2. **Create Performance Dashboard**:
   - Web interface showing trends
   - Automatic regression detection
   - Performance badges for README

3. **Standardize Benchmark Suite**:
   - Define standard configurations
   - Regular benchmark schedule
   - Performance regression tests

## Conclusion

The infrastructure for tracking benchmarks across commits is working correctly, but only 2 out of 10 benchmark scripts have been updated to use it. This is why you're not seeing comprehensive performance data across changes. Once all scripts are updated and benchmarks are run regularly, you'll have full visibility into performance trends.
