# Enhanced Memory Management Benchmark

Generated: 2025-06-28T01:20:53.759485Z

## Configuration

- Device: cuda
- Iterations: 20
- Allocation patterns: 16

## Results

| Pool | Avg Alloc (ms) | Avg Dealloc (ms) | Success Rate | Peak Memory (MB) |
|------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|------------------|
| Enhanced (Fragment + Bucketed) | 0.071 | 0.003 | 100.0% | 593.6 |
| Bucketed Only | 0.068 | 0.003 | 100.0% | 1187.2 |
| Standard PyTorch | 0.032 | 0.000 | 100.0% | 1644.4 |

## Key Findings

- Fastest allocation: Standard PyTorch (0.032 ms)
- Most reliable: Enhanced (Fragment + Bucketed) (100.0% success)

### Enhanced Pool Features:
- Automatic strategy selection based on allocation size
- Fragment-aware allocation reduces memory fragmentation
- Bucketed allocation optimizes common transformer patterns
- Adaptive bucket creation handles irregular allocation sizes
