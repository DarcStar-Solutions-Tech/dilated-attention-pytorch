# Ring Attention Memory Pool Integration Benchmark

Generated: 2025-06-27T21:20:55.461058Z

## Configuration

- Device: cuda
- Batch Size: 2
- Sequence Length: 8192
- Num Heads: 8
- Head Dim: 64
- Ring Size: 4
- Iterations: 5
- PyTorch Version: 2.7.1+cu126

## Basic Performance Comparison

| Configuration | Time per iteration | Peak Memory | Time Improvement | Memory Improvement |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|------------------|--------------------|
| Without Pool | 0.0833s | 425.0MB | - | - |
| Full Pool | 0.1213s | 857.2MB | -45.7% | -101.7% |
| Lightweight Pool | 0.1055s | 1289.2MB | -26.7% | -203.3% |

## Key Findings

- ⚠️ **Performance cost**: 26.7% slower with lightweight pool
- ⚠️ **Memory overhead**: 203.3% more memory usage initially

### Ring Attention Memory Pool Benefits:
- Enhanced communication buffer management
- Optimized allocation for output accumulators
- Configurable pool strategies (full vs lightweight)
- Automatic buffer cleanup and reuse
- Optional memory profiling for distributed scenarios
- Reduced allocation overhead for large sequences
