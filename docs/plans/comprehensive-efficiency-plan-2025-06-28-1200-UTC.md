# Project-Wide Efficiency Improvement Plan

Generated: 2025-06-28T12:00:00Z

## Background

Profiling results show that several components still allocate many temporary
tensors and spend time in pattern generation. The existing memory pool helps,
but not all modules use it consistently. This plan proposes steps to streamline
memory usage and reduce overhead.

## Objectives

1. **Reduce repeated tensor allocations** across attention modules.
2. **Unify caching of pattern indices** so all variants share the same logic.
3. **Improve documentation and examples** to encourage efficient usage.
4. **Add lightweight benchmarks** to measure progress over time.

## Action Plan

### 1. Audit Memory Pool Usage
- Inspect modules like `ImprovedDilatedAttention` and
  `BlockSparseRingDilatedAttention` to ensure they call the
  `get_enhanced_memory_pool` helper when `enable_memory_pool=True`.
- Add unit tests verifying that large temporary tensors come from the pool.

### 2. Consolidate Pattern Caching
- Move sparse pattern generation from individual classes into a shared
  utility in `dilated_attention_pytorch/core`.
- Cache indices on the CPU and reuse them across forward passes and modules.

### 3. Benchmark Key Paths
- Create simple scripts under `benchmarks/` that measure forward pass time for
  different sequence lengths.
- Record results in JSON files to track improvements.

### 4. Improve Documentation
- Extend the README to include guidance on enabling the memory pool and when
  Flash Attention 3 is available.
- Summarize best practices in a new guide under `docs/guides/`.

### 5. Continuous Profiling
- Add an optional environment variable to enable lightweight profiling during
  tests. When set, use PyTorch's profiler to capture memory stats and save them
  under `analysis/`.

## Expected Impact

Implementing these steps should reduce peak memory usage by roughly 10–20%
and cut per-step latency by 5–10% on typical workloads. Exact numbers will be
validated via the new benchmark scripts.

## Timeline

- **Week 1**: Memory pool audit and unit tests.
- **Week 2**: Shared pattern caching utilities.
- **Week 3**: Benchmark script creation and documentation updates.
- **Week 4**: Profiling hooks and evaluation.
