# Content-Adaptive Attention Patterns Guide

## Overview

Content-adaptive attention patterns learn which positions should attend to each other based on the input content, rather than using fixed sparse patterns. This allows the model to dynamically adjust its attention connectivity to capture the most relevant dependencies for each input.

## Key Concepts

### Adaptive Sparsity

Unlike fixed patterns (local window, hierarchical, etc.), adaptive patterns:
- Learn importance scores for each potential attention connection
- Select the most important connections dynamically
- Adapt to input characteristics (e.g., more connections for complex inputs)
- Can be trained end-to-end with the main model

### Architecture Components

1. **Importance Scorer**: Neural network that evaluates connection importance
2. **Block Summaries**: Efficient representation of attention blocks
3. **Differentiable Selection**: Gumbel-softmax for gradient-friendly top-k
4. **Temperature Annealing**: Transition from soft to hard selection

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
from dilated_attention_pytorch import create_adaptive_block_sparse

# Create adaptive attention module
attention = create_adaptive_block_sparse(
    embed_dim=768,
    num_heads=12,
    segment_lengths=[2048, 4096, 8192],
    dilation_rates=[1, 2, 4],
)

# Forward pass
output = attention(query, key, value)

# Get learned patterns
output, pattern_info = attention(query, key, value, return_pattern=True)
patterns = pattern_info["patterns"]  # List of patterns per head
```

### Custom Configuration

```python
from dilated_attention_pytorch import BlockSparseAdaptive, AdaptiveConfig

# Configure adaptive behavior
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    base_sparsity=0.9,              # Target 90% sparsity
    temperature=1.0,                # Initial Gumbel temperature
    learnable_temperature=True,     # Allow temperature to be learned
    min_temperature=0.1,            # Minimum temperature after annealing
    hidden_dim=128,                 # Importance scorer hidden size
    num_layers=2,                   # Importance scorer depth
    share_across_heads=False,       # Head-specific patterns
    hard_sparsity=False,            # Use soft selection for training
)

attention = BlockSparseAdaptive(
    segment_lengths=[2048, 4096],
    dilation_rates=[1, 2],
    num_heads=12,
    head_dim=64,
    adaptive_config=config,
)
```

## Training with Adaptive Patterns

### Temperature Annealing

Temperature annealing helps transition from exploration to exploitation:

```python
from dilated_attention_pytorch import AdaptiveSparsityTrainer

# Create trainer for temperature annealing
trainer = AdaptiveSparsityTrainer(
    model=attention,
    initial_temperature=1.0,
    final_temperature=0.1,
    annealing_steps=10000,
)

# In training loop
for batch in dataloader:
    output = model(batch)
    loss = compute_loss(output)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
    
    # Update temperature
    trainer.step()
```

### Pattern Analysis

Analyze learned patterns during or after training:

```python
# Analyze patterns on validation data
pattern_stats = trainer.analyze_patterns(
    dataloader=val_dataloader,
    num_samples=100
)

print(f"Average sparsity: {np.mean(pattern_stats['sparsity_ratios']):.2%}")
print(f"Pattern diversity: {np.mean(pattern_stats['pattern_diversity']):.2f}")
```

## Adaptive Behavior Examples

### Input-Dependent Sparsity

The model learns to adjust sparsity based on input complexity:

```python
# Simple/repetitive input → Higher sparsity (fewer connections)
simple_input = torch.ones(1, 1024, 12, 64)
output, patterns = model(simple_input, simple_input, simple_input, return_pattern=True)
# May use 95% sparsity

# Complex/varied input → Lower sparsity (more connections)
complex_input = torch.randn(1, 1024, 12, 64)
output, patterns = model(complex_input, complex_input, complex_input, return_pattern=True)
# May use 85% sparsity
```

### Head Specialization

Different attention heads can learn different pattern types:

```python
config = AdaptiveConfig(share_across_heads=False)

# Head 0 might learn local patterns
# Head 1 might learn long-range patterns
# Head 2 might learn periodic patterns
# etc.
```

## Implementation Details

### Importance Scoring

The importance scorer evaluates potential connections:

```python
# For each query-key block pair
importance_score = ImportanceScorer(
    concat(query_summary, key_summary)
)

# Select top-k connections per query
selected = gumbel_softmax_topk(importance_score, k=connections_per_query)
```

### Block-Level Processing

For efficiency, patterns are learned at block level:
- Sequence divided into blocks (e.g., 64 tokens each)
- Block summaries computed (e.g., mean pooling)
- Importance scored between block pairs
- Pattern applied to full attention computation

### Gradient Flow

Gradient flow through discrete selection:
1. **Soft Selection**: Continuous relaxation for training
2. **Hard Selection**: Discrete patterns for inference
3. **Straight-Through Estimator**: Optional for hard training

## Best Practices

### 1. Initialization

Start with reasonable sparsity:
```python
# Too sparse initially → poor gradient flow
# Too dense initially → slow training
config = AdaptiveConfig(base_sparsity=0.9)  # Start with 90%
```

### 2. Temperature Schedule

Anneal temperature gradually:
```python
# Fast annealing → premature convergence
# Slow annealing → soft patterns too long
trainer = AdaptiveSparsityTrainer(
    annealing_steps=total_steps // 4  # Anneal over 25% of training
)
```

### 3. Regularization

Add sparsity regularization if needed:
```python
# Encourage desired sparsity level
sparsity_loss = model.get_sparsity_loss()
total_loss = task_loss + 0.01 * sparsity_loss
```

### 4. Evaluation

Compare fixed vs adaptive patterns:
```python
# Evaluate on diverse test sets
# Adaptive should excel on varied inputs
# May match fixed patterns on uniform inputs
```

## Advanced Features

### Dynamic Sparsity Ratio

Adjust sparsity based on sequence length:

```python
def get_adaptive_sparsity(seq_len):
    # Longer sequences → higher sparsity
    if seq_len < 1024:
        return 0.8
    elif seq_len < 4096:
        return 0.9
    else:
        return 0.95
```

### Multi-Scale Adaptation

Combine with hierarchical patterns:

```python
# Adaptive selection within hierarchical structure
# Fine level: adaptive local patterns
# Coarse level: adaptive global patterns
```

### Hardware-Aware Patterns

Optimize for specific hardware:

```python
# Align pattern blocks with GPU architecture
# E.g., multiples of 32 for tensor cores
config = AdaptiveConfig(
    block_size=64,  # Good for most GPUs
)
```

## Comparison with Fixed Patterns

| Aspect | Fixed Patterns | Adaptive Patterns |
|--------|---------------|-------------------|
| Flexibility | Low | High |
| Training Cost | None | Moderate |
| Inference Cost | Low | Slightly higher |
| Generalization | Task-agnostic | Task-specific |
| Interpretability | High | Moderate |

## Troubleshooting

### Patterns Not Changing

If patterns remain static:
1. Check temperature is decreasing
2. Ensure gradients flow (use soft selection)
3. Verify importance scorer is learning
4. Try different initialization

### Too Dense/Sparse

If patterns are extreme:
1. Adjust base_sparsity
2. Modify k (connections per query)
3. Add regularization
4. Check input preprocessing

### Poor Performance

If adaptive performs worse than fixed:
1. Ensure sufficient training
2. Try simpler importance scorer
3. Verify pattern quality on validation
4. Consider hybrid approach

## Future Directions

### Planned Enhancements

1. **Conditional Patterns**: Patterns conditioned on task/domain
2. **Hierarchical Adaptation**: Multi-scale learned patterns
3. **Continuous Sparsity**: Fully differentiable attention weights
4. **Pattern Distillation**: Transfer learned patterns to fixed

### Research Opportunities

1. **Theoretical Analysis**: Why certain patterns emerge
2. **Pattern Visualization**: Better understanding tools
3. **Cross-Task Transfer**: Reusing learned patterns
4. **Efficiency Improvements**: Faster pattern selection

## Conclusion

Content-adaptive attention patterns provide a powerful way to learn task-specific sparse attention structures. By dynamically selecting which positions attend to each other based on input content, models can achieve better performance than fixed patterns while maintaining computational efficiency. The key is careful configuration, proper training procedures, and understanding when adaptive patterns provide the most benefit.
