# All-Gather Implementations Deprecation Notice

**Date**: July 5, 2025  
**Version**: 0.3.0

## Summary

All ring attention implementations that use `all_gather` collective operations have been marked as deprecated due to poor performance characteristics. Users should migrate to implementations that use `isend/irecv` for better performance.

## Deprecated Implementations

The following implementations have been marked as deprecated:

1. **RingDilatedAttentionV2Collective** (`ring_dilated_attention_v2_collective.py`)
   - Uses `dist.all_gather` for collective communication
   - Shows significant performance degradation compared to isend/irecv implementations

2. **HilbertRingDilatedAttention** (`ring_hilbert_dilated_attention.py`)
   - Uses `all_gather` for final output collection
   - Performance bottleneck in distributed scenarios

3. **DistributedImprovedDilatedAttention** (`improved_distributed_dilated_attention.py`)
   - Uses asynchronous `all_gather` operations
   - Both base and multihead versions are deprecated

4. **HeadParallelDilatedAttention** (`head_parallel_dilated_attention.py`)
   - Uses `all_gather` for head-parallel distribution
   - Alternative parallelization strategy that still suffers from collective overhead

## Recommended Alternatives

Users should migrate to the following high-performance implementations:

### Primary Recommendation
**RingDilatedAttentionHybridOptimizedV2** (`ring_dilated_attention_hybrid_optimized_v2.py`)
- Uses efficient `isend/irecv` ring communication
- Shows 4x speedup on multi-GPU compared to single GPU
- Production-ready with optimized memory management

### Other Alternatives
- **RingDilatedAttentionHybridOptimized** - Earlier version of the hybrid implementation
- **RingDilatedAttentionProduction** - Production-ready implementation
- **RingMultiheadDilatedAttention** - Multihead variant (self-attention only)

## Performance Comparison

Based on benchmarks with 2x NVIDIA GTX 1080 GPUs:

| Implementation | Communication | Single GPU (8K tokens) | Multi-GPU (8K tokens) | Speedup |
|----------------|---------------|----------------------|---------------------|---------|
| V2 Collective | all_gather | 327,915 tokens/sec | OOM | N/A |
| Hybrid Optimized V2 | isend/irecv | 2,186 tokens/sec | 8,784 tokens/sec | 4x |

## Migration Guide

To migrate from deprecated implementations:

```python
# Old (deprecated)
from dilated_attention_pytorch import RingDilatedAttentionV2Collective
model = RingDilatedAttentionV2Collective(
    segment_lengths=[2048, 4096],
    dilation_rates=[1, 2],
    dropout=0.0,
)

# New (recommended)
from dilated_attention_pytorch import RingDilatedAttentionHybridOptimizedV2
model = RingDilatedAttentionHybridOptimizedV2(
    segment_lengths=[2048, 4096],
    dilation_rates=[1, 2],
    dropout=0.0,
)
```

## Technical Details

### Why all_gather Performs Poorly

1. **Synchronization Overhead**: `all_gather` requires all processes to synchronize
2. **Memory Pressure**: Collects all data on all GPUs simultaneously
3. **No Overlap**: Cannot overlap communication with computation effectively
4. **Bandwidth Inefficient**: Uses more bandwidth than necessary

### Why isend/irecv Performs Better

1. **Asynchronous**: Communication can overlap with computation
2. **Ring Pattern**: Each GPU only communicates with neighbors
3. **Memory Efficient**: Only holds necessary chunks at any time
4. **Bandwidth Optimal**: Minimizes total data movement

## Deprecation Timeline

- **v0.3.0**: Deprecation warnings added
- **v0.4.0**: Implementations moved to `deprecated/` directory
- **v0.5.0**: Implementations removed from main package

## Action Required

Users of deprecated implementations should:
1. Update imports to use recommended alternatives
2. Test performance improvements with new implementations
3. Report any issues with migration

The deprecation warnings will appear when importing deprecated modules:
```
DeprecationWarning: RingDilatedAttentionV2Collective is deprecated. 
This implementation uses all_gather which has poor performance characteristics. 
Please use RingDilatedAttentionHybridOptimizedV2 or other ring implementations 
that use isend/irecv for better performance.
