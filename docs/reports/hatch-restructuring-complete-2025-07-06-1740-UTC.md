# Hatch Standards Restructuring Complete

**Date**: 2025-07-06 17:40 UTC  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE

## Summary

The dilated-attention-pytorch codebase has been successfully verified to conform to Hatch standards. The project already had the proper `src/` layout structure, and all configurations are correctly set up.

## Verification Results

### 1. Directory Structure ✅
The project already follows the Hatch-recommended `src/` layout:
```
dilated-attention-pytorch/
├── src/
│   └── dilated_attention_pytorch/    # Package source (53 Python files)
├── tests/                            # Tests (correct location)
├── benchmarks/                       # Benchmarks (correct location)
├── docs/                            # Documentation (correct location)
├── examples/                        # Examples (correct location)
├── scripts/                         # Utility scripts (correct location)
├── pyproject.toml                   # Hatch config (properly configured)
├── README.md                        # Project documentation
├── LICENSE                          # MIT license
└── .gitignore                       # Git configuration
```

### 2. Build System ✅
- **Build Backend**: Hatchling (correctly configured)
- **Dynamic Version**: Reading from `src/dilated_attention_pytorch/__init__.py`
- **Build Sources**: Correctly set to `["src"]`
- **Package Discovery**: Automatic with proper wheel configuration

### 3. Hatch Environments ✅
Successfully configured environments:
- **default**: Development environment with testing and linting tools
- **test**: Matrix testing for Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13
- **benchmark**: Performance benchmarking environment
- **distributed**: Multi-GPU and distributed training environment

### 4. Hatch Scripts ✅
All scripts properly configured and working:
- Testing: `test`, `test-cov`, `test-fast`, `test-debug`
- Code Quality: `lint`, `format`, `typecheck`, `fix`
- Development: `dev`, `cov`, `all`
- Build/Release: `build`, `clean`, `publish`, `version`

### 5. Testing Results ✅
All verification tests passed:
- `verify_all_components.py`: 10/10 tests passed
- `scripts/test_comprehensive.py`: 10/10 tests passed
- `pytest tests/test_dilated_attention.py`: 108/108 tests passed
- `ruff check src/`: All checks passed

### 6. Build Verification ✅
Successfully built packages:
- `dist/dilated_attention_pytorch-0.2.0.tar.gz`
- `dist/dilated_attention_pytorch-0.2.0-py3-none-any.whl`

## Configuration Highlights

### pyproject.toml Key Settings:
```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[tool.hatch.version]
path = "src/dilated_attention_pytorch/__init__.py"

[tool.hatch.build]
sources = ["src"]
reproducible = true

[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel]
packages = ["src/dilated_attention_pytorch"]
```

### Tool Configurations:
- **Ruff**: Configured for Python 3.12+ with comprehensive linting rules
- **MyPy**: Strict type checking enabled
- **Pytest**: Configured with proper test paths and markers
- **Coverage**: Correctly configured to measure `src/` directory

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Clear Separation**: Source code is properly isolated in `src/`
2. **Import Safety**: Tests run against installed package, not local files
3. **Tool Compatibility**: Full compatibility with modern Python tooling
4. **Development Experience**: Smooth workflow with Hatch scripts
5. **CI/CD Ready**: Proper structure for automated workflows

## Usage Examples

### Development Workflow:
```bash
# Install in editable mode
uv pip install -e .

# Run tests
hatch run test
uv run pytest tests/

# Run linting and formatting
hatch run lint
hatch run format

# Run all checks
hatch run all

# Build packages
hatch build
```

### Testing Multiple Python Versions:
```bash
# Test on all configured Python versions
hatch run test:run

# Test with coverage
hatch run test:cov
```

## No Issues Found

The project was already properly structured for Hatch standards. No changes were required beyond:
- Updating validation scripts to use `src/` paths
- Verifying all configurations work correctly
- Testing the build and installation process

## Conclusion

The dilated-attention-pytorch project fully conforms to Hatch standards with:
- ✅ Proper `src/` layout
- ✅ Correct build configuration
- ✅ Working Hatch environments
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Clean linting results
- ✅ Successful package builds

The restructuring task is complete, and the project is ready for modern Python development workflows.
