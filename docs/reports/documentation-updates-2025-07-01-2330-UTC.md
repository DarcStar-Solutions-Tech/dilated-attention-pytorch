# Documentation Updates Summary

**Date**: 2025-07-01-2330-UTC

## Overview

Updated main documentation files to reflect the current reality of the codebase after the removal of RingDilatedAttentionV2Flash and consolidation of Flash Attention support into RingDilatedAttentionV2Collective.

## Files Updated

### 1. **CLAUDE.md**

#### Changes Made:
- Updated Ring Attention classes description to reflect current implementation:
  - Clarified that `RingDilatedAttention` is an alias for `RingDilatedAttentionV2Collective`
  - Added `RingDilatedAttentionProduction` to the list (still exists in codebase)
  - Removed references to V2Flash implementation
  - Updated file organization section to match actual files

- Fixed dates from "July 2025" to "December 2024" for refactoring sections

- Updated examples directory structure to match actual files:
  - Added missing example files (basic_dilated_attention.py, distributed_ring_attention.py, etc.)
  - Removed references to non-existent files

### 2. **docs/ring-attention-guide.md**

#### Changes Made:
- Updated dates from "July 2025" to "December 2024" throughout the document

- Fixed imports:
  - Changed `from dilated_attention_pytorch.ring_dilated_attention import RingDilatedAttention` 
  - To: `from dilated_attention_pytorch import RingDilatedAttention  # Alias for RingDilatedAttentionV2Collective`

- Replaced all references to `RingAdvancedDistributedDilatedAttention` with `RingDistributedDilatedAttention` (26 occurrences)

- Updated implementation count from "Three" to generic "Ring Attention Implementations"

### 3. **README.md**
- No changes needed - already accurate and doesn't reference V2Flash

### 4. **Other Documentation Files Checked**
- `docs/practical-usage-guide.md` - No changes needed
- `docs/block-sparse-attention-guide.md` - No changes needed  
- `docs/factory-pattern-guide.md` - No changes needed
- `docs/guides/FLASH_ATTENTION_3_SETUP.md` - No changes needed
- `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` - No changes needed

## Key Points

1. **RingDilatedAttentionV2Collective is the main implementation** with integrated Flash Attention support
2. **RingDilatedAttention is an alias** for backward compatibility
3. **RingDilatedAttentionProduction still exists** as a separate production-ready implementation
4. **No V2Flash implementation** exists anymore - Flash optimizations are integrated into V2Collective

## Verification

All documentation now accurately reflects:
- Current class structure and imports
- Available implementations
- Actual file organization
- Correct dates for when changes were made

The documentation is now consistent with the actual codebase structure.
