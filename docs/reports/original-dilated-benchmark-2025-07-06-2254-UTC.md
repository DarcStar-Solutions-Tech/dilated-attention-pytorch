### Scaling Analysis

#### 1. Sequence Length Scaling (Batch=1, Heads=8, Dim=64)

| Seq Len | Time (ms) | Memory (MB) | Scaling Factor |
|---------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| 512     | 1.6       | 4.4         | 1.0x           |
| 1,024   | 4.3       | 8.8         | 2.7x           |
| 2,048   | 16.3      | 17.5        | 10.2x          |
| 4,096   | 46.2      | 35.0        | 28.9x          |
| 8,192   | 239.7     | 70.0        | 149.8x         |

**Key Finding**: Time complexity scales as O(n^1.80), slightly better than quadratic.

#### 2. Head Count Scaling (Batch=2, Seq=2048, Dim=64)

| Heads | Time (ms) | Memory (MB) | Scaling Factor |
|-------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| 2     | 8.0       | 8.8         | 1.0x           |
| 4     | 16.0      | 17.5        | 2.0x           |
| 8     | 55.3      | 35.0        | 6.9x           |
| 16    | 91.5      | 70.0        | 11.4x          |
| 32    | 113.3     | 140.0       | 14.2x          |

**Key Finding**: Non-linear scaling with head count, efficiency drops at higher head counts.

#### 3. Batch Size Scaling (Seq=2048, Heads=8, Dim=64)

| Batch | Time (ms) | Memory (MB) | Scaling Factor |
|-------|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| 1     | 33.7      | 17.5        | 1.0x           |
| 2     | 37.5      | 35.0        | 1.1x           |
| 4     | 55.5      | 70.0        | 1.6x           |
| 8     | 293.4     | 140.0       | 8.7x           |

**Key Finding**: Good batch efficiency up to batch=4, significant degradation at batch=8.

## Configuration Impact

### Different Segment Configurations

| Config | Segments | Dilations | Time (ms) | Notes |
|--------|----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Standard | [1024, 2048] | [1, 2] | 93.4 | Baseline |
| More Segments | [512, 1024, 2048] | [1, 2, 4] | 92.1 | Similar performance |
| Extreme Dilation | [512, 1024, 2048, 4096] | [1, 4, 16, 64] | 37.9 | Faster with extreme dilation |

## Memory Analysis

### Memory Efficiency
- **Consistent Usage**: 8.75 KB per token across all sequence lengths
- **Linear Scaling**: Memory usage scales linearly with sequence length
- **Peak Usage**: 156 MB for 16K sequence length

### Memory Breakdown (Approximate)
- Q, K, V tensors: 3 × seq_len × embed_dim × 2 bytes
- Attention weights: seq_len × seq_len × 2 bytes (dominant factor)
- Output tensor: seq_len × embed_dim × 2 bytes

## Performance Characteristics

### Strengths
1. **Memory Efficient**: Linear memory scaling per token
2. **Flexible Configuration**: Supports various segment/dilation patterns
3. **Stable Performance**: Consistent behavior across configurations

### Limitations
1. **No Flash Attention**: Falls back to standard attention on GTX 1080
2. **Quadratic Complexity**: O(n^1.80) scaling limits long sequences
3. **Head Count Scaling**: Performance degrades with many attention heads

## Optimization Opportunities

1. **Flash Attention**: Would provide significant speedup on newer GPUs
2. **Memory Pool**: Could reduce allocation overhead
3. **Kernel Fusion**: Custom kernels for dilated patterns
4. **Mixed Precision**: Better FP16/BF16 optimization
5. **Attention Caching**: Reuse computations across segments

## Recommendations

### For Short Sequences (≤4K)
- Original implementation performs well
- Use batch size 2-4 for optimal throughput
- Standard segment configuration is efficient

### For Long Sequences (>4K)
- Consider alternative implementations (Ring Attention)
- Use extreme dilation to reduce computation
- Reduce batch size to 1 for memory efficiency

### Hardware Considerations
- Upgrade to Ampere+ GPU for Flash Attention support
- Current GTX 1080 limits optimization potential
- Memory bandwidth is likely bottleneck

## Conclusion

The original DilatedAttention implementation provides a solid baseline with:
- Good performance for sequences up to 4K tokens
- Efficient memory usage (8.75 KB/token)
- Flexible configuration options

However, for production use with long sequences or high throughput requirements, consider:
- Ring Attention variants for O(n) memory complexity
- Hardware with Flash Attention support
- Optimized implementations with memory pooling and kernel fusion
