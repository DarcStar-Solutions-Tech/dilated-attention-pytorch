# Ring Attention Cleanup Verification

**Date**: 2025-07-01 21:10 UTC  
**Action**: Verified removal of all debugging scripts and tests for removed implementations

## Verification Results

### ✅ Test Files Removed
- `tests/test_ring_v2_deepspeed.py` - REMOVED
- `tests/test_ring_v2_fairscale.py` - REMOVED

### ✅ Implementation Files Removed
- `dilated_attention_pytorch/ring_dilated_attention_v2_deepspeed.py` - REMOVED
- `dilated_attention_pytorch/ring_dilated_attention_v2_fairscale.py` - REMOVED
- `dilated_attention_pytorch/ring_dilated_attention_v2_fsdp.py` - REMOVED

### ✅ Debug Scripts Cleaned
- `scripts/debug/patch_all_v2_cuda_fix.py` - REMOVED (obsolete after implementations removed)

### ✅ No Remaining Imports
Verified that no test files or scripts import the removed implementations:
- Checked all `tests/*ring*v2*` files - none import removed implementations
- Checked all scripts in `scripts/debug/` - no references to removed implementations

### Files That Appropriately Reference Removed Implementations
These files mention the removed implementations in documentation/reports, which is appropriate:
- Documentation reports explaining the removal
- Benchmark results comparing implementations before removal
- Git history and cleanup documentation

## Summary
All debugging scripts and test files specifically created for the removed DeepSpeed, FairScale, and FSDP implementations have been successfully removed. The codebase is now clean and focused on the two remaining implementations:
1. `RingDilatedAttentionV2Collective` - Baseline using all-gather
2. `RingDilatedAttentionV2Robust` - True ring communication with async P2P
