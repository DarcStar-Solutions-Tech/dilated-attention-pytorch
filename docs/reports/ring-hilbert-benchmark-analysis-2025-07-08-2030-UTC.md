### 2. Memory Efficiency (KB per token)

| Sequence Length | Standard MHA | Dilated Attention | Ring+Hilbert |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|--------------|

### 3. Hilbert Ordering Impact

Based on focused comparison benchmarks:

#### Configurations Where Hilbert Helps (>1.1x speedup):
- **Seq=8,192, Batch=1, Heads=16**: 1.37x speedup
- **Seq=4,096, Batch=2, Heads=8**: 1.25x speedup
- **Seq=2,048, Batch=2, Heads=8**: 1.11x speedup

#### Configurations Where Hilbert Hurts (<0.9x speedup):
- **Seq=8,192, Batch=2, Heads=8**: 0.49x (2x slower)
- **Seq=4,096, Batch=1, Heads=8**: 0.65x
- **Seq=2,048, Batch=1, Heads=16**: 0.19x (5x slower)

### 4. Scaling Characteristics

#### Sequence Length Scaling (Ring+Hilbert)
- 1K → 2K tokens: 25x slower (poor scaling)
- 2K → 4K tokens: 1.3x slower (good scaling)
- 4K → 8K tokens: 2x slower (expected O(n) scaling)

#### Memory Scaling
- Memory usage scales approximately linearly with sequence length
- Ring attention successfully maintains O(n) memory complexity

## Recommendations

### When to Use Ring Attention with Hilbert

✅ **Use Hilbert ordering when:**
- Working with specific configurations that show benefits (see list above)
- Cache locality is critical for your hardware
- You can tolerate performance variance

❌ **Avoid Hilbert ordering when:**
- Consistent performance is more important than peak performance
- Working with configurations that show degradation
- Implementation complexity is a concern

### General Guidelines

1. **For sequences < 4K tokens**: Standard attention may be sufficient unless memory is constrained
2. **For sequences 4K-16K tokens**: Dilated attention provides good balance of performance and memory
3. **For sequences > 16K tokens**: Ring attention becomes necessary for memory efficiency
4. **Hilbert ordering**: Enable selectively based on your specific configuration and requirements

### Optimization Suggestions

1. **Profile First**: Test Hilbert ordering with your specific workload before enabling
2. **Configuration Tuning**: The benefits are highly configuration-dependent
3. **Consider Alternatives**: For consistent performance, standard Ring attention without Hilbert may be preferable
4. **Hardware Considerations**: Results may vary significantly on different GPU architectures

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Hilbert Curve Integration
- The implementation uses Hilbert curve ordering to improve cache locality
- Memory access patterns are reorganized to follow the space-filling curve
- No additional memory overhead compared to standard Ring attention

### Performance Variance
- High standard deviations observed (often >50% of mean)
- Likely due to cache effects and GPU scheduling
- Consider running more iterations for production benchmarks

## Conclusion

While Hilbert curve optimization shows promise for specific configurations, the overall benefits are inconsistent and configuration-dependent. The average speedup of 0.91x suggests that for most use cases, the added complexity may not be justified. However, for specific workloads that match the beneficial configurations, speedups of up to 1.37x are achievable.

Future work should focus on:
1. Understanding why certain configurations benefit while others degrade
2. Developing adaptive strategies to enable Hilbert only when beneficial
3. Testing on newer GPU architectures with different cache hierarchies
4. Investigating alternative space-filling curves or ordering strategies
