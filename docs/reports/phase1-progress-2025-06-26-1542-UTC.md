# Phase 1: Foundation Improvements Progress

Generated: 2025-06-26 15:42 UTC

## Overview

This document tracks progress on Phase 1 of the ROADMAP.md - Foundation Improvements (Q1 2025).

## Phase 1.1: Critical Bug Fixes (Weeks 1-2)

### Tasks

- [ ] Fix thread safety bug in cache access (dilated_attention.py:166-171)
  - Issue: Code modifies `out` tensor without proper synchronization
  - Impact: Race condition when multiple threads access same attention module
  
- [ ] Resolve memory leak in buffer tracking (memory_pool.py:91)
  - Issue: WeakValueDictionary might hold circular references
  - Impact: Memory usage grows unbounded in long-running applications
  
- [ ] Add ring size validation for distributed scenarios
  - Issue: Missing validation that sequence length is divisible by ring_size × segment_length
  - Impact: Silent data corruption or crashes during distributed execution
  
- [ ] Fix gradient normalization order mathematical error
  - Issue: Normalization by num_groups happens after dropout (mathematically incorrect)
  - Impact: Incorrect gradients during training

## Phase 1.2: Test Coverage & Reliability (Weeks 3-4)

### Tasks

- [ ] Add distributed ring attention integration tests
- [ ] Implement stress tests for memory pools
- [ ] Add numerical stability tests for extreme values
- [ ] Create performance regression test suite
- [ ] Add CI/CD tests with actual multi-GPU setups

## Phase 1.3: Flash Attention 3 Integration (Weeks 5-8)

### Tasks

- [ ] Complete FA3 support for all attention patterns
- [ ] Implement FA3 block-sparse optimizations
- [ ] Add FA3 auto-detection and fallback
- [ ] Optimize for H100 Tensor Core utilization
- [ ] Benchmark FA3 improvements (target: 2x speedup)

## Phase 1.4: Memory Management Overhaul (Weeks 9-12)

### Tasks

- [ ] Implement fragment-aware memory pools
- [ ] Add size bucketing for efficient allocation
- [ ] Create adaptive cleanup based on memory pressure
- [ ] Implement NUMA-aware allocation for multi-socket
- [ ] Add memory profiling and monitoring tools

## Progress Summary

- **Total Tasks**: 20
- **Completed**: 0
- **In Progress**: 0
- **Blocked**: 0

## Next Steps

1. Start with critical bug fixes - these are blocking production use
2. Set up proper multi-GPU testing environment
3. Begin Flash Attention 3 integration planning

## Notes

- Priority order: Critical bugs → Test coverage → FA3 → Memory management
- Each completed task should include tests and documentation
- Performance benchmarks required for optimization tasks
