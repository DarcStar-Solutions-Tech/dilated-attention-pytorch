Memory Pool Integration Guide for improved_distributed_dilated_attention.py
============================================================

Module: DistributedImprovedDilatedAttention, DistributedImprovedMultiheadDilatedAttention
Priority: HIGH

Large tensors that would benefit from pooling:
  - communication buffers
  - gradient buffers

Integration Steps:
1. Add memory pool imports at the top of the file
2. Add enable_memory_pool parameter to __init__ (default=False)
3. Initialize self._memory_pool in __init__ when enabled
4. Add _allocate_tensor and _deallocate_tensor methods
5. Replace large tensor allocations with _allocate_tensor calls
6. Add corresponding _deallocate_tensor calls in cleanup/del methods

Example locations to update:

  - In __init__(): Pre-allocate communication buffers
  - In forward(): Use for gradient accumulation buffers
  - In all_reduce operations: Use pooled buffers
