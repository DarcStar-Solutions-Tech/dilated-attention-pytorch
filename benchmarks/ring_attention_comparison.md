## Key Observations

### Memory Usage
- **Expected**: O(n/k) memory scaling - each GPU should use ~1/2 memory with 2 GPUs
- **Actual**: Same memory usage on both configurations
- **Reason**: The implementation appears to be processing the full sequence on each GPU rather than splitting it

### Performance
- **Communication Overhead**: Significantly higher than expected 10-15%
- **Slower with 2 GPUs**: 2-3x slower due to communication overhead without memory benefit
- **Not Following Ring Pattern**: The implementation is not properly distributing sequences

### Effective Sequence Per GPU
With proper ring attention:
- 1 GPU: 32,768 tokens total
- 2 GPUs: 16,384 tokens per GPU (should enable 65,536 total)

## Conclusion

The RingDistributedDilatedAttention implementation is:
1. ✅ Successfully initializing with multiple GPUs
2. ✅ Detecting distributed environment correctly
3. ❌ Not implementing true O(n/k) memory scaling
4. ❌ Adding significant communication overhead without benefit

### Root Cause Identified

After investigation, RingDistributedDilatedAttention uses `ImprovedMultiheadDilatedAttention` as its core (line 422-424), not true ring attention. It's a misnomer - the class provides distributed training features but NOT ring attention's memory benefits.

**Recommendation**: Use a different implementation for true ring attention with O(n/k) memory scaling.
