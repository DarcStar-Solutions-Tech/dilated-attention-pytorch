# Legacy requirements.txt - now managed by pyproject.toml
# For modern Python development, use:
#   pip install -e .                    # Install package
#   pip install -e .[dev]               # Install with dev dependencies  
#   pip install -e .[all]               # Install with all optional dependencies
#
# Or with uv (recommended):
#   uv pip install -e .
#   uv pip install -e .[dev]
#   uv pip install -e .[all]
#
# Or with hatch:
#   hatch shell                         # Enter development environment
#   hatch run test                      # Run tests
#   hatch run lint                      # Run linting  
#   hatch run all                       # Run all checks

# For backwards compatibility, install base dependencies:
