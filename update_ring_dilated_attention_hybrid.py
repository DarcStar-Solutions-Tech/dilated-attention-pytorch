This update fixes the dilated attention computation to properly implement
segment-wise dilation while preserving ALL optimizations.

## Steps to apply:

1. The key change is replacing global dilation with segment-wise dilation
2. Update the forward() method to use the new _ring_forward_with_dilated_segments()
3. Add the new methods listed above
4. Remove the _apply_dilation_to_tensor() method
5. Ensure all imports remain the same

## What's preserved:
- All V2 optimizations (memory pool, caching, Flash Attention)
- All V3 features (ring communication, LSE accumulation)
- All hardware-aware execution paths
- All error handling and fallbacks

The fixed implementation is in: {fixed_file}
