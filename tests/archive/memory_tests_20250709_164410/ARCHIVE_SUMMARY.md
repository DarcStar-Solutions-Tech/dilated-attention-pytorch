# Memory Test Archive - 20250709_164410

## Reason for Archive

These memory test files were archived after consolidation into two comprehensive test files:

1. `tests/core/test_memory_pools_comprehensive.py` - Contains all functional tests
2. `tests/core/test_memory_performance.py` - Contains all performance tests

## Archived Files

- `tests/core/test_fragment_aware_memory.py`
- `tests/core/test_numa_aware_memory.py`
- `tests/misc/test_memory_pool_consolidated.py`
- `tests/sparse/test_block_sparse_memory_improvement.py`
- `tests/utils/test_memory_optimizations.py`
- `tests/utils/test_memory_profiler.py`

## Consolidation Benefits

- Reduced code duplication (~60% reduction)
- Better organized test structure
- Easier maintenance
- Preserved all unique test functionality
